4!s is a normal enough contract, and so the key is how many tricks will be made.
West will probably lead a diamond, which gives declarer the opportunity to take
a ruffing finesse in the suit on the second round. Now it is a matter of making
a good guess in trumps. If West plays low when a trump is led from the South
hand, declarer will make only ten tricks if the ten is played, but there is an
opportunity to end up with twelve tricks on the correct guess. If West rises
with the king, declarer will make eleven. So, I expect the field to be divided
between these three results, with the odd pair in 3NT, and some getting too
high.
